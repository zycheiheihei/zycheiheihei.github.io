title: "To Make Yourself Invisible with Adversarial Semantic Contours"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/zhang2023make
excerpt: 'This paper proposes to take use of object semantic contours to enhance the sparse attack, <i>i.e.,</i> $\ell_0$-constrained attack, on modern object detectors. We design a prior over the object contour for pixel selection and defines Adversarial Semantic Contours (ASC) as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate under a Bayesian formulation of $\ell_0$-constrained sparse attack. Comprehensive experiments are conducted to verify the attack performance of ASC with 9 modern detectors in 3 datasets.'
