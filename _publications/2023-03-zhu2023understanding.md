title: "Understanding the Robustness of 3D Object Detectors with Bird’s-Eye-View Representations in Autonomous Driving"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/zhu2023understanding
excerpt: 'This paper conducts thorough evaluation on the robustness of vision-dependent 3D object detectors with explicit Bird’s-Eye-View (BEV) representations. The evaluation concerns both natural robustness and adversarial robustness under classic settings for computer vision and novel proposed settings specifically for auto-driving. The experimental results provide critical insights into the properties of BEV and could inspire future works to develop better BEV-based algorithms.'
